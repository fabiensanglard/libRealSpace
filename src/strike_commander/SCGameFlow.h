/**
 * SCGameFlow is a class that manages the game flow of the game.
 *
 * It contains a RSGameFlow object which parses the game flow data from a PAK file.
 * It also contains a RSOption object which parses the options from a PAK file.
 * It contains a PakArchive object which stores the shapes and palettes of the game.
 * It contains a vector of background objects which stores the backgrounds of the game.
 * It contains a pointer to a uint8_t array which stores the raw palette of the game.
 * It contains a pointer to a uint8_t array which stores the palette of the game.
 * It contains a map of uint8_t to animatedSprites objects which stores the sprites of the game.
 * It contains a uint8_t variable which stores the ID of the current mission.
 * It contains a uint8_t variable which stores the ID of the current scenario.
 * It contains a uint8_t variable which stores the ID of the next mission.
 * It contains a int variable which stores the current frame rate of the game.
 * It contains a uint8_t variable which stores the ID of the current sprite.
 * It contains a uint8_t variable which stores the ID of the current option.
 * It contains a uint8_t variable which stores an unknown value.
 * It contains a pointer to a char array which stores the name of the mission to fly.
 * It contains a pointer to a vector of EFCT objects which stores the effects of the game.
 * It contains a pointer to a vector of SCZone objects which stores the zones of the game.
 *
 * It contains a queue of SCConvPlayer objects which stores the conversations of the game.
 * It contains a queue of SCShot objects which stores the cutscenes of the game.
 * It contains a queue of SCStrike objects which stores the strikes of the game.
 *
 * It has a constructor which initializes the object.
 * It has a destructor which deletes the object.
 * It has a Init method which initializes the object.
 * It has a createMiss method which creates a new mission.
 * It has a RunFrame method which runs the game frame.
 * It has a renderMenu method which renders the menu of the game.
 * It has a clicked method which handles the clicking of a sprite.
 * It has a runEffect method which runs the effects of the game.
 * It has a checkKeyboard method which checks the keyboard for input.
 * It has a CheckZones method which checks the zones of the game.
 * It has a createScen method which creates a new scenario.
 * It has a getShape method which gets a shape from the PakArchive.
